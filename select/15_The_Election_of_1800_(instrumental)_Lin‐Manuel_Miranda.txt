The election of 1800
Can we get back to politics, please
Yo, every action has an equal opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed I love the guy but he's in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now I'm facing Aaron Burr, with his own faction
He's very attractive in the North, New Yorkers like his chances
He's not very forthcoming on any particular stances
Ask him a question, he glances off, he obfuscates, he dances
And they say I'm a Francophile
At least they know I know where France is
Thomas, that's the problem
See, they see Burr as a less extreme you
Huh?
You need to change course
A key endorsement could redeem you
Who did you have in mind?
Don't laugh
Who is it?
You used to work on the same staff
Whaaat?
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
Talk less! (Burr)
Smile more! (Burr)
Don't let them know what you're against or what your for (Burr)
Shake hands with him! (Burr)
Charm her! (Burr)
It's 1800! Ladies, tell your husbands, vote for Burr!
I don't like Adams
Well, he's gonna lose, that's just defeatist
And Jefferson?
In love with France
Yeah, he's so elitist
I like that Aaron Burr
I can't believe we're here with him
He seems approachable
Like you could grab a beer with him
Dear Mr. Hamilton
Your fellow Federalists would like to know how you'll be voting
It's quiet uptown
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn't stand a chance, so who are you promoting?
It's quiet uptown
Jefferson or Burr? (Jefferson or Burr?)
We know it's lose-lose
Jefferson or Burr? (Jefferson or Burr?)
But if you had to choose
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn't stand a chance, so who are you promoting?
But if you had to choose?
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr, sir
Alexander!
You've created quite a stir, sir
I'm going door to door!
You're openly campaigning?
Sure!
That's new
Honestly, it's kinda draining
Burr?
Sir?
Is there anything you wouldn't do?
No, I'm chasing what I want
And you know what?
What?
I learned that from you
If you had to choose, if you had to choose
It's a tie
If you had to choose, if you had to choose
It's up to the delegates
If you had to choose, if you had to choose
It's up to Hamilton
If you had to choose
Jefferson or Burr? (Jefferson or Burr?)
Choose, choose, choose
Yo (Oh!)
The people are asking to hear my voice (Oh!)
The country is facing a difficult choice (Oh!)
But if you were to ask me, who is promote? (Oh!)
Jefferson has my vote (Oh!)
I have never agreed with Jefferson once (Oh!)
We have fought on like 75 different fronts (Oh!)
But when all is said and all is done
Jefferson has beliefs, Burr has none
Well, I'll be damned
Well, I'll be damned
Hamilton's on your side
Well, I'll be damned
Well, I'll be damned
And?
You won in a landslide
Congrats on a race well run
I did give you a fight
Uh huh
I look forward to our partnership
Our partnership?
As your Vice President
Hahahaha, yeah right
You hear this guy?
Man openly campaigns against me
Talkin' 'bout "I look forward to our partnership"
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be Vice President
Ooh, you know what?
We can change that!
You know why!
Why?
'Cause I'm the President
Burr, when you see Hamilton
Thank him for the endorsement
