On the road from London
Couped up with a new three, yeah
Got a foursome, tryna come kick it with me, yeah
Big glock cocked on 'em
Won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em
Rock his ass to sleep, yeah
On the road from London
Couped up with a new three, yeah

Big glock cocked on 'em
Won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em
Rock his ass to sleep, yeah

Can't take nothing from me, I promise
Flight from London to 1800
Wonderin' why in the fuck have they got problems
Jealousy up in their eyes, I feel it when they're watching
Rock him to sleep, yeah
I'm with the Z's, but I ain't sleepin'
Like a blind lifeguard I cannot see shit
Boy you drown in the deep end
Hmm, ridin' 'round the city with Jackboy
Like the s up on the sniper gang logo you backwards
Actin' like you got bricks hidden up in ya mattress
Pay your mom's rent, pussyboy you embarrassing

On the road from London
Couped up with a new three, yeah
Got a foursome, tryna come kick it with me, yeah

Had him speaking through the wire like old school Kanye
Can't hear a word you say, heard ya fucking jawbreak
Unintentional masterpiece
I left your blood up on the pavement
So boy you left the floor stained
Took my kindess for weakness, it backfired
I let you sleep in my yard and I got your racks high
You bit the hand that fed you, you ain't no vampire?
And now you dead to me
Thank you for making me wiser
Demon inside uh, I feel no threat on my life
Spirit protection, I never needed a gun on my side
Smile in the face of death
'Cause if I'm gonna die
Then it's supposed to be
See you in the afterlife
